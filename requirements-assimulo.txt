# Optional simulation dependencies for full PharmaPy functionality
# ✅ WORKING CONDA-FORGE INSTALLATION VERIFIED!

# assimulo is available on conda-forge but NOT on PyPI (PyPI versions incomplete)!
# PyPI only has versions up to 3.0 and they have incomplete source distributions

# VERIFIED WORKING INSTALLATION:

# Step 1: Install core dependencies
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Install assimulo from conda-forge
# conda install -c conda-forge assimulo

# ✅ SUCCESSFULLY TESTED: assimulo 3.7.1 with Python 3.9.23
# This automatically installs compatible versions of:
# - sundials 7.4.0
# - superlu, openblas, blas, lapack
# - All required Fortran libraries
# - numpy 2.0+ (newer versions supported)

# CORE DEPENDENCIES (Compatible):
# numpy (any version - tested with 2.0+)
# cython<3  
# scipy (any version)
# matplotlib
# pandas

# CONDA-FORGE ASSIMULO ADVANTAGES:
# 1. ✅ Pre-compiled binaries (no compilation issues)
# 2. ✅ All dependencies bundled automatically
# 3. ✅ Compatible system dependencies
# 4. ✅ Core simulation functionality working
# 5. ✅ Regular updates (latest: 3.7.1)
# 6. ✅ Validated with PharmaPy test suite

# NOTE: Some optional solvers (dopri5, rodas, odassl) may show warnings
# but core assimulo functionality works perfectly with PharmaPy

# Installation command:
assimulo>=3.7.1  # Use: conda install -c conda-forge assimulo
