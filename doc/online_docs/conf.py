# Configuration file for the Sphinx documentation builder.

# -- Path setup --------------------------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in another directory,
# add these directories to sys.path here. If the directory is relative to the
# documentation root, use os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
#
import os
import sys
from importlib.metadata import packages_distributions, version as distribution_version

# The import package this documentation describes. The distribution that ships
# it is resolved below rather than hardcoded, so packaging renames do not stale
# the docs.
import_package = 'PharmaPy'

# Resolve the installed distribution *before* the source tree goes on sys.path
# below. A checkout can carry build metadata from an earlier editable install --
# in particular a stale `PharmaPy.egg-info` predating the rename to
# `pharmapy-sim` -- and importlib.metadata treats any `*.egg-info` on sys.path as
# an installed distribution. Resolving first keeps that stale metadata out of the
# lookup; doing it after the insert reports both names and fails the build.
#
# `packages_distributions` was added in Python 3.10, so building the docs
# requires 3.10 or newer even though `[project].requires-python` allows 3.9 for
# the package itself. CI, Read the Docs, and the pixi `docs` environment pin 3.11.

        f"documentation from an environment where PharmaPy is installed, for "
        f"example `pixi run docs` or `pip install -e \".[docs]\"`. If several "
        f"names are listed, delete stale `*.egg-info` directories from the "
        f"repository root and reinstall."

# them. nbsphinx defaults to 'auto', which executes any notebook that has no
# outputs; under the warning-as-error docs build (`-W` in CI,
# `fail_on_warning: true` on Read the Docs) an execution error in a notebook
# would then fail the build of an unrelated change. Keeping this 'never' makes
# the build depend only on what is committed. `ipykernel` stays in the docs
# dependencies because nbsphinx still requires a kernelspec to parse notebooks.
