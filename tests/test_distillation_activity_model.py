"""Distillation VLE calls must honor the configured activity model.

``_BaseDistillation`` and ``DynamicDistillation`` accept a ``gamma_model``
option, but several vapor-liquid equilibrium calls omitted it and so fell back
to the ideal default of ``getKeqVLE`` and ``getBubblePoint``. A column
configured with a non-ideal model then ordered feed volatilities, closed its
dynamic material balances, initialized its plate temperatures, and reported
vapor profiles from ideal K-values.

The self-contained two-species fixture needs no repository data. It is a
close-boiling pair in which the heavier-boiling species is dilute and shows a
strong positive deviation from ideality, so its activity coefficient is large
enough to reverse the volatility ordering. An ideal fallback is therefore
visible in the model outputs instead of hiding in the fourth decimal.

Expected K-values are assembled in this module from the fixture Antoine
constants and ``getActivityCoeff`` rather than from ``getKeqVLE``, so the
assertions do not restate the production expression under test.
