"""Regression tests for the shape factor used by ``Cake.get_alpha``.

Issue #160 records that the scalar volumetric shape factor cancels from the
normalized crystal-volume weights. The hydraulic resistance ``alpha`` should
therefore be independent of any positive scalar ``kv``, while the method must
still obtain that factor from its attached solid phase rather than a literal.
