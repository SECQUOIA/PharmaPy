PharmaPy is a pythonic library for the analysis of pharmaceutical manufacturing systems.

It allows to simulate the dynamics of standalone, drug substance unit operations in a variety of operating modes (batch, continuous, semibatch). Also, PharmaPy facilitates setting up and simulating pharmaceutical **flowsheets**, i.e., interconnected unit operations running in one or more operation modes, offering flexibility to simulate end-to-end batch, end-to-end continuous, and hybrid operation schemes (combination of batch and/or continuous and semicontinuous unit operations).

## Installation

Install the core library from a source checkout with:

```bash
python -m pip install .
```

Use the locked pixi environment when you need the optional Assimulo solver
backend. The planned PyPI distribution name is `pharmapy-sim`; the import name
will remain `PharmaPy`.

See the [complete installation guide](https://github.com/PharmaPy-org/PharmaPy/blob/master/INSTALLATION.md)
for virtual-environment setup, editable development, pixi, Assimulo, platform
support, and verification commands.
